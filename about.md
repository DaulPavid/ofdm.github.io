# Paul David - Software Engineer
--------------------------------

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/O3kjwFC.jpg" /></p>

I'm a software engineer with a focus on wireless communications living and working in Atlanta.

My professional interests include signal processing, software development, and RF with a hint of FPGA and hardware design on the side. I have experience with developing error correction codes and other types of decoders in software. I'm also interested in machine learning, and graphics programming, and most of my projects incorporate ideas from these areas.

This webspace is intended to serve as a point of contact for my services and a place to post articles about my projects as well as tutorials.
