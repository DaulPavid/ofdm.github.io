# Paul David - [SDR / DSP / Software] Engineer
----------------------------------------------

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/O3kjwFC.jpg" /></p>

I'm a software engineer with a focus on signal processing living and working in Atlanta.
In particular, my experience is concentrated in wireless communications and software-defined radio (SDR).

Areas of expertise include:
* Waveform development for Internet-of-Things (IoT), satellite communications, and cellular
* [GNU Radio](https://gnuradio.org) and software-defined radio (SDR) prototyping
* Optimized transmitter and receiver design in software
* FPGA design and verification for communication systems

I have experience with various frameworks used in the development of
communication systems, such as GNU Radio, liquid-dsp, and custom development.
In addition, I'm proficient with Verilog and I've had experience with FPGA
design. I also have experience with platforms such as the Ettus USRP and other
software-defined radios.

My professional (and hobby) interests include software development and digital signal processing.
I'm also interested in graphics programming and visualizations, such as writing
OpenGL programs and shaders.

This webspace is intended to serve as a place to post tutorials and articles about my projects.
