# Paul David - Wireless / DSP / Software Engineer
-------------------------------------------------

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/O3kjwFC.jpg" /></p>

I'm a software engineer with a focus on signal processing living and working in Atlanta.
In particular, my experience is concentrated in wireless communications and software-defined radio (SDR).

I have experience with various frameworks used in the development of
communication systems, such as GNU Radio, liquid-dsp, and custom development.
In addition, I'm proficient with Verilog and I've had experience with FPGA
design.

My professional (and hobby) interests include software development and digital signal processing.
I'm also interested in AI, machine learning, and graphics programming, and most of my projects incorporate ideas from these areas.

This webspace is intended to serve as a place to post tutorials and articles about my projects.
