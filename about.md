# Paul David - Software Engineer
--------------------------------

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/O3kjwFC.jpg" /></p>

I'm a software engineer with a focus on signal processing living and working in Atlanta.

My professional (and hobby) interests include software development and digital signal processing. I'm also interested in AI, machine learning, and graphics programming, and most of my projects incorporate ideas from these areas.

This webspace is intended to serve as a place to post tutorials and articles about my projects. If you want to contact me, my e-mail is daulpavid [at] daulpav.id
