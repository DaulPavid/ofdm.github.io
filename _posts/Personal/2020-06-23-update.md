# A Difficult Year

It goes without saying 2020 has been a very difficult year, and I've had a few
prior to this, so it doesn't look like I'll be finding my footing any time soon.
That being said, side projects are always fun to distract from the stressors
in life, and I've got a few in the pipeline.

Currently, I'm focusing on a library and some tooling targeting
GOES LRIT and HRIT, so I can grab awesome images and develop a signal processing
library along the way. The software suite **xRT** will be open source once I get
it to a good spot, and it'll come with some open source tools to help in 
reversing future signals of interest too. I'm also focusing on error correction
algorithms; that's probably where most of the effort is right now.

Initially, I'm just planning on implementing relevant functionality specified
in the
[CCSDS](https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/Forms/AllItems.aspx?View={14363eeb-d5d0-48ac-8125-d884cca0614c}&SortField=Published_x0020_Date&SortDir=Desc)
standards for the link and physical layers corresponding to anything
dealing with space-to-ground communications.
I know that there will be some differences among satellites, but these
documents help in getting some base functionality and scope nailed down.

So stay tuned! I'm going to start posting again, and documenting parts of my
efforts. I will make a post when something is published on GitHub. Until then,
stay healthy!
