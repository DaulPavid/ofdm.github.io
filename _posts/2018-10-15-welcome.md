# Purpose of this Webspace

This site will serve as my spot for posting technical articles and tutorials. 
I have quite a few articles in the works, all of which deal with software design,
communications, and software-defined radio (SDR) in some way. I also
venture into hardware design, and I plan to allocate more time to those
projects as well.

I'm currently working on an implementation brief for turbo
codes, so stay tuned!
